### Selecting maps
Before selecting:

- You can select any map that is __submitted__ on the Rhythia website, or else syncing won't work
- All maps that you select will have to be redownloaded to prevent modifications/changed offsets

How to select:

2. After each user has downloaded and is Ready, you can start the game
3. All the mods that you have selected during map selection, will be synced across all players

Transferring the host:

## Common Issues

### Rhythia Online will not load
Try to restart Rhythia Online, if this does not work try restarting your PC

If you're on a slower connection you might want to wait a while before restarting just incase, Rhythia Online downloads roughly 200mb of data

#### Windows can't find node.exe / Failed to extract files / Percentage stuck at 100%
If this error is being thrown a solution might be to go into ```C:/Users/[USERNAME]/AppData/SoundSpacePlus/Helper```

1. Check if inside ```helper``` there are two folders, one being ```extracted``` another being ```tempt```

2. Look inside ```extracted```. If it is empty, simply take the contents of ```temp``` and copy it over to ```extracted```

3. Create a text file inside ```C:/Users/[USERNAME]/AppData/SoundSpacePlus``` and rename it to ```helper_version```

4. As of __January 3, 2025__ the string inside ```helper_version``` should be ```1735400730872```

4. Relaunch the game
